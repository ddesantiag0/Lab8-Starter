## Short Paragraph about Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Graceful degradation ensures that an application remains functional even if some features are not supported by the user's device or browser. Service workers help with this by enabling offline functionality and caching. They allow the application to work without an internet connection by serving cached resources, making the app more reliable and user-friendly.
